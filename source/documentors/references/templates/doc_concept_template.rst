Concept Document Template
#########################

A concept is a document that clarifies and illuminates a particular topic. It is understanding-oriented. It could be considered a conceptual guide. This type of document answers a why question. It could be descriptive, historical, or even propose different alternatives to explain the bigger picture and give context. 

For example, “What is an XBlock? The Open edX platform provides different components, called XBlocks, that can work to create a course, like text, video, assessment, and discussions.”  (Replace this text with your content.)

Since this type of document seeks to explain a topic, you will likely need to add images to exemplify the topic you are talking about. For example:


.. image:: /_images/documentors_howto/image_example.png
	:width: 500px
	:align: center
	:alt: This image example shows how to access the GitHub repository from the Open edX documentation repository.

External Links
--------------

You can have `inline links <https://docs.openedx.org/en/latest/documentors/references/quick_reference_rst.html#linking>`_ and `indirect links`_, that are useful if you want to link to the same thing multiple times, or if the URL is really long and you want things to read more cleanly.

.. _Indirect links: https://docs.openedx.org/en/latest/documentors/references/quick_reference_rst.html#linking

Internal Links
--------------

Link to :doc:`doc_how_to_template` in the same folder or :doc:`../quick_reference_rst` in a different
folder.

By default, it will use the title of the doc as the link text but you can override that with :doc:`other text </doc_how_to_template>` if you want.
